# GYRE-SPIRAL-VORTEX-REPORT-TOOL-
This application utilizes a novel visualization algorithm known as the "Gyre Function" (G(t)) to transform linear system logs into radial forensic artifacts, allowing for the rapid detection of cyclic anomalies, "cron shadows," and distributed denial of service (DDoS) patterns.
Vortex Report Tool: Gyre Function Analytics
📄 Project Disclosure & Proposal
Date of Disclosure: October 26, 2023 Subject: Radial Projection Algorithms for Time-Series Forensics
This repository houses the source code and functional specifications for the Vortex Report Tool. This application utilizes a novel visualization algorithm known as the "Gyre Function" (G(t)) to transform linear system logs into radial forensic artifacts, allowing for the rapid detection of cyclic anomalies, "cron shadows," and distributed denial of service (DDoS) patterns.
🌀 Core Methodology: The Gyre Function
The core intellectual property of this tool is the transformation logic that maps a linear event E(t) onto a polar coordinate system (r, \theta).
1. Standard Gyre Mode (Cyclic Analysis)
Used for routine health checks and identifying drift in scheduled tasks.
Formula: r = \alpha t, \theta = \frac{2\pi t}{P}
Target Discovery: "Cron Shadows" (recurring errors at fixed angles) and Shift Drift.
2. Singularity Gyre Mode (Incident Forensics)
Used for analyzing system crashes. It defines a Singularity Point (t_{sing}) where r=0.
Mechanism: Events prior to t_{sing} spiral inward; events after t_{sing} spiral outward.
Opposed Chirality: The system supports an invertOpposed configuration, forcing pre-crash and post-crash vortices to rotate in opposite directions (Clockwise vs. Counter-Clockwise) to visually separate cause from effect.
🛠 Feature Specifications
Gyre Density Score (GDS)
A calculated metric representing events per radian.
GDS > 3.0 indicates non-human, algorithmic activity (brute force loops).
Anomaly Snapshots ("Hot Sectors")
The engine automatically detects angular segments with high event density and generates cropped, high-resolution snapshots for forensic reports.
